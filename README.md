CalgaryPulse is a living AI simulation of Calgary's entire economy. Citizens click on any building to see their taxes, explore policy trade-offs through an AI sandbox, discover uses for vacant downtown spaces, and vote on city priorities  all powered by agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, and large language models

THIS IS OUR Agent-based model, RL, LLM, forecasting
